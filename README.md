We got the hierarchy of game objects working, 
Add child, remove child, reparent. The thing it is still in progress
Is to apply transformations in cascade.

Camera is a component. 

Frustum culling not implemented.

Mouse picking is work in progress.

Resource system is work in progress, we have some minor issues to fix before making it work. So for now is not active in the release to avoid unexpected crashes.
Usually in debug you can drag drop files and will import them and make ready all the custom files, and load pre-existing files.
If an asset is duplicated it won't be imported.

Custom file format is implemented.

Play/stop button not implemented.

Scene serialisation is work in progress.

The street house is not set as we had some last minute issue with the obj imported we where using until now.
