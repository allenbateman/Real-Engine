Unlike Unreal Engine this engine will make games feel real.

This project is a University subject, the idea behind is to learn how to build a 3D game engine. The main goal is to deliver a program that handles files and able to modify them and have a nice program layout. It consist of three deliveries, the first one is to deliver a Geometry viwer, have a camera that renders 3D objects, and have some render settings. The second delivery is to handle new files, drag and drop, and have a some what engien editor. And for the third and las delivery is to build a specific tool that helps the deveopment process of a game over the engine editor as it can be an animator tool, shader pipeline, audio system and some more.



Using some libraries as helpers, we are happy to say that is a great learning procress of a major program system.

Understanding in depth rendering and file management is in a great part hard. But over all is fun and solidifies the basics of resource management and optimizations to improve our games in our game developer journey.

## A1 - Geometry Viwer



## A2 - Engine Editor

We got the hierarchy of game objects working, 
Add child, remove child, reparent. The thing it is still in progress
Is to apply transformations in cascade.

Camera is a component. 

Frustum culling not implemented.

Mouse picking is work in progress.

Resource system is work in progress, we have some minor issues to fix before making it work. So for now is not active in the release to avoid unexpected crashes.
Usually in debug you can drag drop files and will import them and make ready all the custom files, and load pre-existing files.
If an asset is duplicated it won't be imported.

Custom file format is implemented.

Play/stop button not implemented.

Scene serialisation is work in progress.

The street house is not set as we had some last minute issue with the obj imported we where using until now.

## A3 - Tool Implementation
